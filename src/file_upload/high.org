#+TITLE: DVWA - File Upload High
#+AUTHOR: Leonardo Tamiano

* Description
  In this challenge we increase our checks as follows

  - file extension
  - image size
  - image format

  #+begin_src php
 // File information
    $uploaded_name = $_FILES[ 'uploaded' ][ 'name' ];
    $uploaded_ext  = substr( $uploaded_name, strrpos( $uploaded_name, '.' ) + 1);
    $uploaded_size = $_FILES[ 'uploaded' ][ 'size' ];
    $uploaded_tmp  = $_FILES[ 'uploaded' ][ 'tmp_name' ];

    // Is it an image?
    if( ( strtolower( $uploaded_ext ) == "jpg" || strtolower( $uploaded_ext ) == "jpeg" || strtolower( $uploaded_ext ) == "png" ) &&
        ( $uploaded_size < 100000 ) &&
        getimagesize( $uploaded_tmp ) ) {

        // Can we move the file to the upload folder?
        if( !move_uploaded_file( $uploaded_tmp, $target_path ) ) {
            // No
            echo '<pre>Your image was not uploaded.</pre>';
        }
        else {
            // Yes!
            echo "<pre>{$target_path} succesfully uploaded!</pre>";
        }
    }
    else {
        // Invalid file
        echo '<pre>Your image was not uploaded. We can only accept JPEG or PNG images.</pre>';
    }
  #+end_src
  
* TODO Solution
  The idea here is to mask the phpshell file with the MAGIC numbers of
  a PNG file and with the magic numbers of a PNG file.
